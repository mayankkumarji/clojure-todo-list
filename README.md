# Todo

A Clojure project created to understand the flow of a web app developed with clojure. We have used clojure + postgresql primarily in this project and gradually added datomic in place of postgresql.

## Requirements

This project will require the installation of clojure related dependencies and postgresql as database on the system (to run the code from master branch).

We have added a datomic branch on which we are migrating the current project from clojure + postgresql to clojure + datomic.
